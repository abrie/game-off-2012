                You are a lowly rodent: a three legged chinchilla.
                Cruel Fate has robbed you of your quadrupedal mobility.
                Nature has denied you the memory of how the limb came to be forsaken.
                Your Disposition endows you with an insatiable thirst for fame and fortune.
            </p>

            <p>
                The road is difficult, and first you must become a Master of Velocity Ball.
                The object of the game is to push the ball, and not pass the ball. Get it up
                to speed before it rolls out of bounds. If you succeed then you'll progress
                to the next level.
            </p> 

            <p>
                So off we go to Brocolli Forest. 
                There an old master will teach you how to push.
                Push until you've pulled yourself up.
            </p>

            <p>
                Player controls are "L,K, and J" pressed in various combinations.
            </p>
