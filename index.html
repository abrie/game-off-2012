            <p>You are a lowly rodent: a three legged chinchilla. Cruel Fate has robbed you of your quadrupedal mobility.
            Nature has denied you the memory of how the limb came to be forsaken. Nonetheless, you maintain an
            unquenchable thirst for fame and fortune by any means.</p>
            <p>You must become a Master of Velocity Ball. The object is to push the ball, and not pass the ball.
            Get it up to speed before it rolls out of bounds. If you succeed then you'll progress to the next level.
            Maybe you'll learn a thing or two along the way.</p>
            <p>Push, Chinchilla! Push until you've pulled yourself up.</p>
