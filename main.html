        You are a lowly rodent: a three legged chinchilla. Cruel Fate has robbed
        you of your quadrapedal mobility. Nature has denied you the memory
        of how it came to be forsaken. Nonetheless, you maintain an unquenchable 
        thirst for fame and fortune by any means. And that means you must become 
        an expert at Velocity Ball. The object is to push the ball, and push the
        ball. Get it up to speed before it rolls out of bounds. If you succeed then
        you'll progress to the next level. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two along
        the way. So --- push, Chinchilla! Push until you've pulled yourself up!
